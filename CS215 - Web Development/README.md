This was a pretty fun class I took in 2022. Pure vanilla HTML + CSS + JS. These days, I'd prefer a TS + React + .NET stack, but I still have a soft spot for this simple setup.

Over the course of the 6-week semester, we built this simple polling website. The functionality is according to the assignment document. Criticisms towards certain functional decisions can be pointed towards the University of Regina. The code is definitely still my fault, though.

I hard coded credentials into this, which is obviously a big no-no. These days I obviously know much better. When I uploaded this to github, I forgot that I hardcoded them. So I also know git rebase.

I've gotten a lot since making this.
