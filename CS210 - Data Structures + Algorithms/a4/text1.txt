Today is a fun day, I played with a cat named Miss Kitty and she stays too often on the counter.
We tell her not to go on the counter, but she insists it is fun. Sometimes giving her treats ie not enough.
How often do you run into this issue with your cat? That Miss Kitty is a funny cat!
This is the third time I am writing Miss Kitty's name.
