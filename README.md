# CS Coursework

This repository contains code samples from some of my courses at the UofR. Some courses or assignments will include a README to provide context on the assignment, if necessary.

A lot of what you see here, especially in my earlier courses, might be considered terrible code. I'm with you.  There likely isn't a single project in here that I wouldn't make significant modifications to, as the programmer that I am today. However, I'm leaving them unedited from the time of submission. 

These programs were written specifically for the assignment I was given. There's a lot of memory leaks in this repository. In such cases, please bear in mind that I was not marked on memory leaks for that given assignment and do in fact know the `delete` keyword. Imperfect code gives us something to talk about â˜º
