# CS Coursework

This repository contains code samples from some of my courses at the UofR. Some courses or assignments will include a README to provide context on the assignment, if necessary. **I will be adding code samples from my 400 level CS courses periodically until April 2025.**

A lot of what you see here, especially in my earlier courses, might be considered terrible code. I'm with you.  There likely isn't a single project in here that I wouldn't make significant modifications to, as the programmer that I am today. However, I'm leaving them unedited from the time of submission. 

There's a couple of reasons for this. One, I don't really want to redo them. Secondly, I think my growth as a developer can still be gleamed from what's here. Could I *better* demonstrate my growth by rewriting the old assignments knowing what I know now? Well yeah, probably, but see point one.

I'm a very goal-oriented person. I program specifically for the assignment I'm given. There's a lot of memory leaks in this repository. In such cases, please bear in mind that I was not marked on memory leaks for that given assignment and do in fact know the `delete` keyword. Sometimes the code is sloppy. That's because what you're seeing is code written for a very specific purpose: marks. The way I write disposable assignment code is not the way I write production code, which I unfortunately can't share. 

I have no shortage of unfinished personal projects which I think better demonstrate my coding style, but I don't really like the idea of showing off something unfinished. I'm sure I'll finish one eventually. But if you're hiring and you'd like to see what some of my unfinished Unity C# code looks like, please feel free to ask and I can grant you access to those repos.
