Potentially my favourite class. Making video games in C/C++ with basic openGL. Lots of fun, learned lots of C++ tricks. There is a known issue that sometimes appears in a5 where fish flocking behaviour breaks when the leader is eaten by the player. 

Would do a lot of things differently. I began on the code not really thinking about what features would be implemented down the line, so it's a bit messy. We had the opportunity to use the "Solution" code when starting new assignments, but I was stubborn and stuck with my code all the way through. 

If I did it again: smart pointers, way more reasonable inheritance hierarchy.

Things I'm OK with: big main file (we only have one scene/loop and will never expand on it, so it's fine), overall things work at intended, with only one major bug that I know about that would likely be fixed by smart pointers.
